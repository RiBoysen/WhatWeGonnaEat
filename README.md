# WhatWeGonnaEat

This project is about what we going to eat. 

I have moved on my self, and come to think, what am I going to eat tonnight... I was searching on the web for any suggestions that are tasty and easy to make(20-40 min), that wasnt't as easy i hoped for ;'(
besides that, I was searching for a new project becuase i heard abouth the BotFrameWork from Microsoft
 
so i combined it and think that this is a great project:
The solution will include a BotFramework From Microsoft, Api using C# and a Database(Api uses EF to connect to the database).

The Bot wil only get the user input and thatslate it so it knows what the user wan't, taht asking the Api for the for Data.
